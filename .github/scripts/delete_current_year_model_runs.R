# Script to delete a list of model runs by ID from AWS.
#
# Accepts one argument, a comma-delimited list of run IDs for model runs
# whose artifacts should be deleted.
#
# Assumes that model runs are restricted to the current assessment cycle, where
# each assessment cycle starts in May. Raises an error if no objects matching
# a given ID for the current year could be located in S3. This error will get
# raised before any deletion occurs, so if one or more IDs are invalid then
# no objects will be deleted.
#
# Example usage (delete the runs 123, 456, and 789 in the current year):
#
#   delete_current_year_model_runs.R 123,456,789

#      ID
#   2. Even if aws.s3::delete_object could raise an error for missing objects,
#      we want to alert the caller that one or more of the IDs were incorrect
#      before deleting any objects so that this script is nondestructive
#      in the case of a malformed ID
